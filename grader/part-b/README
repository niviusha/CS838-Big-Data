The src contains all the source code for the GraphX programs and the 
target contains the jar files.

The programs can be run as "sh file-name.sh" or "./file-name.sh"

For all the GraphX programs, I have used the file "vertices.txt" in 
which each line denotes a vertex and contains comma separated words 
denoting the most frequent words at that time interval. This file was
read as stored in the graphX vertex data structure. Since the vertices
in grpahX are RDDs, using the cartisian product, the appropriate 
edge connections was determined.

The page rank algorithm was run on Live Journal data using the Pregel
API implemented in GraphX.
